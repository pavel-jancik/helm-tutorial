# Run as helm template ./02-whitespaces

Edit this file and see efect on rendered values by running:

 {{ "{{-" }} resp. {{ "-}}" }}, i.e., meaning of the `-`

Citations:
```cite
if an action's left delimiter (by default {{ "\"{{\"" }}) is followed immediately by a minus sign and white space, 
 all trailing white space is trimmed from the immediately preceding text. 
...
For this trimming, the definition of white space characters is the same as in Go: 
  space, horizontal tab, carriage return, and newline.
```

Similarly to bash, the pipe `|` passes output=value of the previous expression to the other one.

Tasks: 
* try and see how the below content is rendered
* understand why that happened, play with it to see what the - character is doing

* play with indent / nindent funtion.
